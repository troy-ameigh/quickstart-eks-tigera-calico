                          jobs are created to generate a report, and the job generates the
                          report data from archived audit and traffic data. To ensure this
                          data is actually archived, the jobs to generate each report starts
                          at a configurable time *after* the end time of the report that is
                          being generated. The default job start delay is 30m, but is configurable
                          through the compliance-controller environments. The cron format
                          has minute accuracy, but only up to two values may be configured
                          for the minute column which means you may only have at most two
                          reports for each hour period.

                                    maps to the specified externalName. "ClusterIP" allocates
                                    a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.
                                    Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is
                                    not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints
                                    object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated
                                    and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints
                                    rather than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP
                                    and allocates a port on every node which routes to the
                                    clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates
                                    an external load-balancer (if supported in the current
                                    cloud) which routes to the clusterIP. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types'
