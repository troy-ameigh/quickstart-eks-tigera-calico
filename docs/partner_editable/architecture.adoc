As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following in your Kubernetes cluster:

* The Tigera Operator and associated resources in its own namespace.
* A custom resource which configures the {partner-product-name} installation.
* {partner-product-name} resources in the `calico-system` namespace.

Figure 2 shows additional resources created for {partner-product-name} Enterprise:

* The `tigera-system` namespace, which runs the Tigera API server.
